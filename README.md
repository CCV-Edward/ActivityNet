# ActivityNet
2016 ActivityNet action recognition challenge. CNN + LSTM approach. Multi-threaded loading.

Notes: 
    - Did not finish before challenge deadline
    - Bug in LSTM forced use of regular RNN (investigate error & fix if re-using)
    - Need to find a faster way to load videos with lua (currently slower than training)
